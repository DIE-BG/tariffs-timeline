Search for all factual news published between February 17 and February 24, 2026,
regarding tariff-related actions taken by the United States government. Include
all industries and all types of actions: new tariffs, increases, suspensions,
official threats, or proposals. Also include any retaliatory measures announced
or implemented by other countries in response to U.S. tariffs. Focus strictly on
factual information — exclude any editorial commentary or opinion. Provide a
structured summary in English, preferably with tables listing the country, type
of action, affected goods, and date of the announcement. Include official
actions and news form reputable sources. Cover official government announcements
and actions, and reports from reputable news outlets about potential or
unofficial tariff developments. I want the search to include both U.S.
government actions and responses by foreign governments (retaliatory tariffs,
etc.). Include actions or proposals even if they are not yet finalized (e.g.,
draft proposals or threats). I like the sources linked in the summary. Focus
only on tariffs directly involving the United States. Include links to official
government sites and top-tier news outlets.
